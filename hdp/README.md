📝 Project Report: Heart Disease Prediction Web Application
📌 Project Title
Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning – Web Application

🎯 Objective
The main goal of this project is to develop a web-based machine learning application that predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on clinical input parameters. This tool can assist doctors or users in early detection, thus promoting preventive healthcare.

🧠 Problem Statement
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis can save lives. However, interpreting multiple health metrics can be complex for non-specialists. This project aims to simplify this process by providing an intelligent system that takes in patient data and predicts the presence or absence of heart disease.

📊 Dataset
Name: Heart Disease UCI Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Attributes: age, sex, chest pain type (cp), resting blood pressure (trestbps), cholesterol (chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), etc.

Target Variable: target (0 = no disease, 1 = disease)

🔍 Workflow
Data Loading & Cleaning

Loaded heart-disease.csv

Handled missing values and outliers (if any)

Converted categorical features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed the relationship between features and target variable

Visualized feature importance

Model Building

Trained models using:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors

Random Forest Classifier

Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Model Selection

Selected the best-performing model

Exported as model.pkl using joblib

Web Integration

Built a simple form using HTML

Developed a Flask server to handle input and return predictions

Final result is displayed on the browser:
“✅ You are unlikely to have heart disease.”
“⚠️ You may have heart disease. Please consult a doctor.”

🖥️ Web Interface Features
User inputs:

Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Cholesterol, Resting BP, etc.

Real-time prediction

Simple, mobile-friendly layout

Prediction result is easy to understand

✅ Outcomes
Functional ML-based web app that predicts heart disease

Provides a real-world application of data science, web dev, and healthcare

Deployed locally and can be extended to cloud platforms for public access

🚀 Future Improvements
